Tao - Tasks United

About

Issues, requests, tickets, tasks, projects (and subtasks, subprojects), todo items, 
change requests and all sorts of such elementary particles of work have, "historically",
the respective tools of their kinds for managing them, each implementing everything
from the Big Bang to the Qantum Computers, again, and again, with little respect to 
how similar these things and the related workflows are.
