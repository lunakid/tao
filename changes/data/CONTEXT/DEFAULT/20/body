Separate the GUI stuff into, perhaps, descendant classes. 

Only have global stuff around, which is relevant for the specific tool incarnation (like session_start, print_page & friends for PHP).

Stuff shared by tool variants should be in common classes. (Also keep in mind implementing them in a common binary lib.)
