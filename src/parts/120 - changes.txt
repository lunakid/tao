TODO:
	! Deleting an item from the details page should close the details 
	  page! (Some actions should actually mean something to the tool, 
	  or these side-effects should be triggered by the app config?)

	! Dblclk-open does not mark the item as being "in focus".

	! Some items have an id attr. file, some don't... (Each on is in
	  an ID dir regardless!)
	  The id files should be replaced by optional mnemonic files!

HISTORY:

  0.287 - 2014-03-11
	- Change history is now tracked by the change database under 
	  tao/changes (and in the GIT commit history).
	- Added a simplistic build (= glue) srcipt (and phase...).
	- Fixed self URL.
	- Several small refactoring and minor UI changes.

  0.286 - 2014-03-11
	- Fix explicit DB change by (GET) request.
	- Added some padding to the subject lines in the list.
	- Embedded the form observer javascript to avoid loosing data on a 
	  mistaken submit due to the script not having been loaded for any 
	  reason.
	- Added err() calls instead of echos.

  0.285 - 2014-03-10
	- Added check to skip file_get_contents() if no 'title'.
	- Removed '&' before 2 file_get_contents() calls.
	- Renamed print_logo to print_banner.
	- Added date_default_timezone_set() to silence warnings from PHP 5.1 up.
	- Not using short PHP tag now.
	- Added error_reporting(E_ALL).
	- set_magic_quotes_runtime() is only called if supported.
	- Renamed 'cache_syncwrite' to 'cache_writethrough'
	- Fixed 'get property of non-object' errors (line 265/266).
	- Minor styling of the issue list. (Body margins added, ID field widened.)
	- Using <script> location=... redirecting, as header(loc.) does nothing
	  for some reason (perhaps only on Node.js?)
	- Added DOCTYPE "html" (which means HTML5 now).
	- Added jQuery 1.11.1 (via Google CDN).
	- Added JS doubleclick-open to issues summary lines.
	- Renamed "iteration" to "phase" to be more straightforward to a wider
	  audience.
	- Fixed Notice: Undefined variable: newstate_label on line 666
	- Changed label "Cancelled" to "Deleted" in the test DB (now being consistent
	  with the button labels, and also with the context dir names...).
	- Added Esc-close to the details page. (No check for changes yet! :-o )
	- Add check for changes and prevent Esc-close on the details page.
	- Added http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-observe/ for form input 
	  change tracking.
	- Add CREATED timestamp to new items.

  0.284-pre2

	- Added lots of missing isset()s.

	- Upgraded to use file_get_contents (requires PHP 4.3.0!)

	  *** The effect of the now missing unmagicquote() call ***
	  *** is UNCHECKED yet!                                 ***

  	PENDING:
  	
  	- See: http://project/todo/current/changes/

	- Caching problem (seems to be IE-related):

		1. The body of most recently added item STILL missing 
		   from the "Details" page till a couple of seconds / minutes

		2. After adding a new item and then immediately restarting
		   IE6, the most recently added item is missing from the list.
		   for a couple of seconds (minutes)?
		   OTOH, Mozilla does this right.

  0.283

    	This History added.
  	Merged 0.283 back to the main branch.

  	PENDING:

  	That caching problem:

		1. The body of most recently added item STILL missing 
		   from the "Details" page till a couple of seconds / minutes

		2. After adding a new item and then immediately restarting
		   IE6, the most recently added item is missing from the list.
		   for a couple of seconds (minutes)?
		   OTOH, Mozilla does this right.

  0.282a
  
	1. This version is to isolate the following bug: 

		1. body of most recently added item missing from the
		details

			--> It gets written, but does not get
			read back. It does not happen consistently.
			Supposedly an ODB property caching problem.
		
			No, it's a session caching problem! (Timestamp
			tests revealed this.)

		2. then (after restarting the browser) the whole 
		most recently added item missing from the list

			--> this part seems to be a simple
			browser caching problem

	2. Some comments added/fixed.
