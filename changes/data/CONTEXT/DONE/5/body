What should MRU mean? Last opened? Last changed? Last "activated"? 

In this latter case: if "activation" is used "semantically" (as defined by the configuration/DB), then this tool does nothing about that concept at all... 

Perhaps MRU should also be a "void" concept to the app, and the configuration should describe what properties should drive an MRU listing order (there may even be multiple listing orders, and the "MRU" concept may not even apply any more, meaning something more specific, like "order by last-modified time" or "order by 'set to state X' time".
