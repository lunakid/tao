Tao - Tasks United [WIP, EXP, NSFW, ETC!]

Tasks, projects, todo items, issues, change requests, support tickets, calendar 
events and all sorts of such "elementary particles" of general "digital process 
automation" have, historically, all the respective tools of their kinds to manage 
them, each separately -- and partially, in isolation -- reinventing and remplementing 
all the gears from the Big Bang to quantum computers, again and again, with little 
respect to how similar these things and their handling processes are.

At the time of this writing, I'm still unaware of a solution that's sufficiently 
general and flexible, so here I just try to lay down the unified fundamentals common
to each of these closely related problems.

Please, if you know any "activity management" tools with a broad enough scope, very
ergonomic UI, maximum flexibility and a minimalistic architecture, file an issue 
on this project at http://github.com/lunakid/tao/.

Note: this project is (obviously) not pretending to be a solution, but a framework
for experimenting: to test ideas, shape requirements and refine techniques, while 
the quest for the holy grail of task management continues.

[SOME LEFTOVER CRAP, MOVE OR DELETE:
Also, apart from being *super easy to use*, requirements as *easy hosting* and
*light maintenance/support burden* for such a tool are mandatory to be practical. 
(While Redmine is great, its UI sucks, and also not everyone can host its RoR server
stack. While ASANA is powerful, and its UI feels OK, its data model and functionality
are lacking, and again, you can't run it yourself. Etc.)
