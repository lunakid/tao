Tao - Tasks United

Issues, tasks, projects (and subtasks, subprojects), todo items, support tickets, 
change requests, "calendar entries" and all sorts of such elementary particles 
of general activities have, historically, the respective tools of their kinds for 
managing them, each implementing everything from the Big Bang to Qantum Computers, 
again and again, with little respect to how similar these things and their handling 
processes are.

Now, obviously, there most likely already are solutions that address the core of
this domain in a sufficiently general and flexible way, I'm just simply unware of it.

Also, apart from maximally *easy-to-use*, requirements of *easy hosting* and *light 
maintenance/support burden* for such a tool are mandatory to be practical. (While 
Redmine is great, not everyone can host a RoR server stack. While ASANA is powerful 
(thoughits data model and functionality are severely lacking), again, you can't run 
it yourself. Etc.) 

Please, if you know tools like that, with broad scope, maximum flexibility and a
minimalistic architecture, file an issue on this project at github.com/lunakid/tao/

Note: this project is (obviously) not a solution, but a framework for experimenting, 
a prototype to demonstrate ideas, shape requirements and techniques, while the quest 
for the Holy Grail of task management continues.
