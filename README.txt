Tao - Tasks United

About

Issues, tasks, projects (and subtasks, subprojects), todo items, support tickets, 
change requests and all sorts of such elementary particles of work have, "historically",
the respective tools of their kinds for managing them, each implementing everything
from the Big Bang to Qantum Computers, again and again, with little respect to how 
similar these things and the their handling processes are.

Now, obviously, there most likely already are solutions that address the core of
this domain in a sufficiently general and flexible way, I'm just simply unware of it.

Also, a requirement of *easy hosting* and *light maintenance/support burden* for such
a tool is mandatory to be practical. (While Redmine is great, not everyone can host 
a RoR server stack. While ASANA is powerful (though data model and UI features are 
severely lacking), again, you can't run it yourself. Etc.) 

Please, if you know tools like that, with broad scope, maximum flexibility and a
minimalistic architecture, file an issue on this project at github.com/lunakid/tao/

Thanks!
