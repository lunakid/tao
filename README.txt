Tao - Tasks United

Issues, tasks, projects (and subtasks, subprojects), todo items, support tickets, 
change requests, "calendar entries" and all sorts of such elementary particles 
of general activities have, historically, the respective tools of their kinds 
for managing them, each separately reimplementing everything from the Big Bang 
to Quantum Computers, again and again, with little respect to how similar these 
things and their handling processes are.

Now, obviously, there most likely already are solutions that address the core of
this domain in a sufficiently general and flexible way, I'm just simply unaware of 
them.

Also, apart from being maximally *easy-to-use*, requirements as *easy hosting* and
*light maintenance/support burden* for such a tool are mandatory to be practical. 
(While Redmine is great, not everyone can host a RoR server stack. While ASANA is 
powerful (though its data model and functionality are severely lacking), again, you 
can't run it yourself. Etc.) 

Please, if you know activity management tools with a broad enough scope, maximum 
flexibility and a minimalistic architecture, and all the merits one might reasonably
think of, file an issue on this project at http://github.com/lunakid/tao/.

Note: this project is (obviously) not a solution, but a framework for experimenting, 
a prototype to test ideas, shape requirements and refine techniques, while the 
quest for the Holy Grail of task management continues.
