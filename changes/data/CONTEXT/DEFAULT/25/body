Not quite possible, unfortunately... :-(

Perhaps the new-window (target="..." stuff) should be dropped and a single-window mode should be favoured instead.

One more reason to drop the multi-window approach: it is bug-prone to propagate the session (noticed by actually producing such a bug as soon as possible... ;-o )
